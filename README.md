# Sleek Template

Sleek Template is a minimal collection of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) packages and settings that ease the writing of beautiful documents. While originally meant for theses, it is perfectly suitable for project reports, articles, syntheses, etc. – with a few adjustments, like margins.

It is composed of four separate packages – `sleek`, `sleek-title`, `sleek-theorems` and `sleek-listings` – each of which can be used individually.

For more information about the packages, settings, environments, commands, etc., please refer to the documentation file [`main.pdf`](main.pdf), which also acts as showcase document.
